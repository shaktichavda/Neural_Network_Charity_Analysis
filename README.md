# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Deliverable 4: Neural Network Charity Analysis

•	Objective: Determine if the organizations funded by Alphabet Soup will be successful or not. 

•	Results: 
Data Preprocessing:
1.	 What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? Is-Successful
2.	What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? Name, Application, Type, Affiliation, Classification, Use Case, Organization, Income Amount, Special Considerations, Status and Ask Amount.
3.	 What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data? Name, Employee Identification and Special Considerations.

•	Summary: An accuracy target of 75% was not received in the Neural Network Model. An alternative could be the use of Random Forest Classifier as accurate results can be achieved due to increased number of estimators and tree depth.
